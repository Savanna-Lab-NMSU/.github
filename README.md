# Dryland Ecology

We study how drylands plant communities function and interact with climate, soils, fire, and herbivory. Namely, what controls woody plant populations in temperate and tropical savannas? Which processes (relating to climate, soils, fire, invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores) affect plant populations, community structure, and ecosystem function at meter to landscape scales? We answer these questions by observing the underlying shifts in structure and plot-scale dynamics of plant communities in response to climate, fire, and herbivory. Currently, one of our special projects is researching the role of termite mounds in landscape-scale hydrology and function. Our research takes place in both our greenhouses and in field sites located in the Jornada long-term ecological research (JRN-LTER) site, Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa, and occasionally other places around the world.
